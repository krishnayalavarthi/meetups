# Learning to rank
  We all witnessed how data science influences our lives in recent years. If we say the impact of data science is rising like a rocket, one of the most powerful engines should be the learning to rank algorithm. Every day all kinds of different lists are generated for you by internet companies like Amazon, Google or Microsoft. All of them have something to do with this important algorithm, but you may not have thought of it in these terms.  
  In this meetup we would give a introduction about learning to rank algorithms and their diverse applications. Also remember to bring your laptop here (with R installed). We would teach you building a priority inbox of email messages for yourself!
